## ✅ 1. **README for Jupyter Notebook — Secure File Vault**

````markdown
# 🔐 Secure File Vault — Jupyter Notebook Version

This project provides a simple file encryption and decryption tool inside a **Jupyter Notebook**.  
It uses **Python’s cryptography library** and interactive **ipywidgets**.

## ✅ Features
- Encrypt any file with a password
- Decrypt previously encrypted files
- Runs directly inside a Jupyter Notebook
- Provides download link after processing

## 🛠️ How to Use
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter or JupyterLab
2. Upload your file using the widget
3. Enter a password (use a strong one)
4. Choose **Encrypt** or **Decrypt**
5. Click **Process File**
6. Download your encrypted or decrypted file

## 🗝️ How Encryption Works
- Uses **Fernet symmetric encryption** from `cryptography`  
- Password is converted into a key (do not forget your password!)  

## 📦 Requirements
```bash
pip install cryptography ipywidgets
````

## 🚀 Demo

> The tool runs directly in your notebook — no deployment needed!

## ✅ 2. **README for Streamlit App — Secure File Vault**

```markdown
# 🔐 Secure File Vault — Streamlit Web App

A beginner-friendly **Secure File Vault** built with **Python**, **Streamlit**, and **Cryptography** library.  
Encrypt and decrypt files directly in your browser — nothing is stored on any server.

## ✅ Features
- Upload any file for encryption or decryption
- Password-protected encryption
- Download encrypted or decrypted files
- Clean, simple web interface powered by **Streamlit**

## 🗝️ How It Works
- Uses **Fernet encryption** with a password-derived key
- All operations happen in memory — files are not saved on any server
- Works for most file types (documents, images, etc.)
